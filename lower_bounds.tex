\section{Lower bounds}

Trivial remark: since the standard MAB is a subcase all the usual lower bounds still hold. In the feasible case $\rho_\lambda>1$ one cannot hope to do better than the $\sqrt{(K-1)T}$, because the best arm has to be discovered in order to allocate the remaining mass appropriately.

\paragraph{Intuitions} Assume $\forall j, \lambda_j >0$. For some $k$, we may try find lower bound on $|\sum_{t=1}^T (x_{k, t}-x_k^\star)|$, since we saw that it is possible to make one of the two regrets negative but in all of our results we get $\cO(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ on this quantity. 

We can design hard problems, e.g. with $2$ arms, $(\lambda_1, \mu_1)=0, 1$, while  $(\lambda_2, \mu_2)=(\epsilon, 2\epsilon)$. A problem with $(\lambda_2, \mu_2)=(\epsilon, 3\epsilon)$ or $(\lambda_2, \mu_2)=(\epsilon, \epsilon)$ leads to a very different optimal allocation ($x_2^\star=1/2$, $1/3$ and $1$ respectively). $\epsilon=1/T$ is too small to distinguish in which setting we are, we have linear regret. This hints that for non vacuous bounds we need to consider $\lambda$ as fixed and independent of $T$.

In that case, we can obtain with standard tools a lower bound of order $\left(\frac{\lambda_k}{\mu_k^2}\sqrt{T} \right)$, which is what we expect since it is the scaling of $\left|\frac{\lambda_k}{\mu_k}-\frac{\lambda_k}{\mu_k+\cO(T^{-1/2})}\right|$. \textcolor{blue}{Write this formally}. If we consider this result, the optimality ratio of our bounds is $\sqrt{\frac{\log(T)}{\alpha_k}}=\sqrt{\frac{\log(T)\mu^+}{\lambda_k}}$.

Note that this bound is a minimax bound if we consider $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [K]}$ as constants. Indeed, we proved that in the feasible case it holds that $\mu_k \geq \frac{\lambda_k}{1- \sum_{i\neq k} \frac{\lambda_i}{\mu^+}}$, so we can also write the lower bound as $\Omega\left(\frac{(1- \sum_{i\neq k} \frac{\lambda_i}{\mu^+})^2}{\lambda_k} \sqrt{T}\right)$. Or to be less precise we can just say that $\mu_k \geq \lambda_k$ (without any assumption) and directly get $\Omega\left(\frac{\sqrt{T}}{\lambda_k}\right)$.
