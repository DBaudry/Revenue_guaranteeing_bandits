\section{TO-DO: August}

An un-organized list of the things to do during Dodo' holidays:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Literature review: Inspired by the review made by the \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05219.pdf}{BanditQ (link)} paper, read all potential interesting works on this topic. Did other people try something close? Are the solutions proposed by these papers close to what we tried? What is missing in them? For Mathieu: links with fairness literature in other domains.
	\item Proof checking: check if all the proofs for MABs are correct (Appendix~\ref{app::K_armed}), validate the concepts and see if there is room for improvement. Start writing theorems. Minor: decide if we keep generic base bandits or we just propose UCB/Successive Elimination algorithms.
	\item Start doing some experiments (K-armed to validate our claims, contextual to see if our solution seems practical).
	\item Decide the algorithm/write the proof for the contextual case. See ideas in Appendix~\ref{app::contextual}. Generic proof? Instantiate it for some usual examples like the linear case? In particular, the analysis may be tailored for more precise setting (sample size $\to$ information collected).
	\item Start thinking about the story: how far do we want to go with our results/do we think that what we have is enough for publication?
	\item Derive lower bounds (see some thoughts in Section~\ref{sec::lower_bounds}).
\end{itemize}
